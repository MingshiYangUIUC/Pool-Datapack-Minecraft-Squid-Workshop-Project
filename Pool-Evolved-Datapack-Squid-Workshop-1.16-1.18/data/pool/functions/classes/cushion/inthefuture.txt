while determining the effect of tilted cushion...

normal reflection: just add 2*tilt to the reflected angle

effect of/on spin: 
	way 1: split the angles based on tilt so that vex and vez is different: treat the plane as 0 degree always, then rotate back subsequent motion
	way 2:

#see log for a better way... for now, just ignore the effect of/on spin in the small scale
